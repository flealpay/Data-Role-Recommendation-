 CONCLUSION 

In comparison to other countries, salaries in America generally appear to be higher, especially for professionals working in leading sectors such as technology, finance, healthcare, and engineering. However, this situation can vary depending on the industry, position, expertise, and geographic location. Salaries in other countries, on the other hand, vary significantly based on economic conditions, industry, and geographic location; there can be a considerable salary gap among professionals in similar positions in developing countries.

In recent years, there has been an increase in salaries in the data sector, driven by the growing demand for expertise in fields like data science and artificial intelligence. However, along with rising salaries, the competitive environment has also significantly increased, prompting employers to offer various incentives to attract and retain qualified professionals. Besides salaries, benefits, flexible working conditions, and career development opportunities also influence professionals' preferences. In this context, the salary increases in the data sector not only provide opportunities but also reflect an environment of heightened competition.
